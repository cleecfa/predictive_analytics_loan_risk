Optimize Finding Loan Prospects Based on Customer's Payment Behavior
Background

The primary threat faced by banks is credit risk. Loss of loan extended to borrowers severely disrupts the lender's cash flows, increase collection costs, and at worst can cause the lenders to go bankrupt.

The Imperial Galactic Bank (IGB) has been historically struggling with loan defaults. However, IGB has no room to take its foot off the gas. Due to recent hike in competition, they have to increase the volume of loans to survive. Furthermore, IGB's management has a mission to increase profits to support the great Emperor Palpatineâ€™s new Death Star venture project.

Goal

Investigate IGB's credit usage data to learn about attributes that are associated with late/missed payments.
Build a statistical solution that IGB's management can consider and apply to future loans to reduce the probability of default.
